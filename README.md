# React Portfolio Site

This is my first portfolio site that I am making with React.js.
It will have a lean design that is visually appealing with just
the necessary information to remain uncluttered

The font I used is Raleway.
The color scheme is : #0A1B26, #80E7F2, #5A90BF, #99C8F2, #275673

The packages I used (as of 23.06.2020) are:

- "react": "^16.13.1",
- "react-dom": "^16.13.1",
- "react-icons": "^3.10.0",
- "react-scripts": "3.4.1"
