# React Portfolio Site

This is my first portfolio site that I am making with React.js.
It will have a lean design that is visually appealing with just
the necessary information to remain uncluttered

The font I used is Raleway.


The packages I used (as of 23.06.2020) are:

- "react": "^16.13.1",
- "react-dom": "^16.13.1",
- "react-icons": "^3.10.0",
- "react-scripts": "3.4.1"
- "react-scroll": "^1.7.16"
- "gh-pages": "^3.1.0"
